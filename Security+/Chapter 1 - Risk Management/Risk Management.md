Risk is the likelihood of a threat actor taking advantage of a vulnerability by using a threat against an IT asset.

**Assets:**
* Can be stuff like your data, servers, printers etc..
* Your critical people
* Services
* Anything that has value.

**Likelihood:**
* The probability of an event actually occurring over time.
* When we talk about likelihood, we're talking about stuff like: How many times will we get hit by an ion cannon within the next year. That would be low likelihood.
* Spam email? Higher likelihood.

**Threat Actors: 
* Things, the people. the organization, whatever it is out there, that can do maliciousness to our infrastructure.

1. Hacker - Classic human being trying to get into an infrastructure.
2. Hacktivist - Hacker with activist lifestyle. Trying to promote their whatever through hacking.
3. Script Kiddies - Where we start. No skills, grab known scripts to do stuff.
4. Insiders - Employee, someone in the cleaning crew, vendor.
5. Competitors - Break in and get business information.
6. Shadow IT: Most nefarious, people who are impatient, purchase WIFI point themselves and all of a sudden there are numerous people within an organization that can access that point. Any IT being put in unofficially or in an illegal way.
7. Criminal Syndicate - Huge problem today, people that will take your money, usually a lot, and do DOS (Denial of Service) on someone.
8. State Actors -  Russians hack into Chinese, state sponsored long term type actors.
9. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) - Long term hacking in order to get info over an extended amount of time.

**Vulnerability:**
* A weakness inherent within an asset.

**Threat:**
* An action, or an explout by a threat actor that they can use against a vulnerability to perform harm to an asset.

We want to reduce threat or eliminate it as much as possible.

**Remediation:**
* Let's look at all these threats and remediate what's out there.
